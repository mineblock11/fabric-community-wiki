## Information

Rendering in the game world can provide for interesting ways to mark locations, convey information to the end user, and much more.

This topic assumes that you have basic knowledge about how computer graphics work. Terms like "Vertecies", "Faces", "OpenGL", etc may often be mentioned.

If you do not know the basics of OpenGL and general computer graphics, you might not understand everything mentioned in these pages.

All content on this wiki uses Yarn mappings - if you aren't using Yarn mappings, you can use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between all mappings (mojmap/parchment etc.)

## Extra help.

If you need extra help or certain concepts further clarified, you can ask in the `#mod-dev-` channels in the Fabric Discord - these channels are places where users give and ask for help with modding, please respect the Fabric Discord's rules.
